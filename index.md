<div style="font-size: 1.2em;">

We are an all year, all day Montessori primary school with all day access to our outside environment. We are two trained teachers, one teacher-in-training, three asistants, twenty-six children, and a community of parents, volunteers, and alumni!

We believe that children can change the world, that children have an innate desire to learn, and that social and emotional development is the foundation for learning. Our vision is to empower our children and the people who surround them to live in peace and service to the world.

Start getting to know us!
