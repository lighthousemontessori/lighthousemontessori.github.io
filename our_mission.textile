p(hint). This is the world we want to create and the world that we work for every day at Lighthouse Montessori school. We hope this is a world you are also excited to be part of creating.

h2. Mission Tests

p(hint). We'll know we're on the right track, because

# The majority of children show concentration in each work period. 
# We each give 2 affirmation / day, and see 2 affirmation from a child / day. 
# 2 circles between May 2014 - Aug 2014. 
# Staff rate trainings as valuable (6/7)+
# Montessori Families - talk to 3 tree, have a plan/ideas + have a name we like

h2. Simple Rules

p(hint). "Simple Rules":http://simplerulesfoundation.org/ lead to congruence in complex systems, like Schools :). These are the rules that guide our decisions.

h3. 1. Listen with curiosity

p(hint). Instead of making our own assumptions, in times of conflict and celebration.

h3. 2. Wait and watch

p(hint). We are aware & responsive, yet we give the space needed for trial and error to unfold. 

h3. 3. Move towards each other

p(hint). We share our experiences when they are great and when they are hard. We choose commecting in all our states because we believe vulnerability builds trust and community.

h3. 4. Search for the true need

p(hint). We understand that humans are mose resilient and open when their basic and core needs are fulfilled. When we see big emotions, we will look with compassion for the basic needs they point towards.
