h2. Vision

*Our community compassionately supports the self-creation of all individuals*

p(hint). This is the world we want to create and the world that we work for every day at Lighthouse Montessori school. We hope this is a world you are also excited to be part of creating.

h2. Mission

In our school, every day: 
...we care for an environment where children find independence, concentration, 
and love. 
...we practice compassion and conflict resolution. 
...we grow at a sustainable pace. 
In our community, 
...we ground ourselves in Montessori principles. 
...we co-create Montessori families, not just children.

p(hint). * We hope to offer tuition assistance in the next couple years, and in so doing, expand to parents that might not otherwise be able to afford Montessori education for their children. We're not there yet, though.

h2. Mission Tests

p(hint). We'll know we're on the right track, because

# The majority of children show concentration in each work period. 
# We each give 2 affirmation / day, and see 2 affirmation from a child / day. 
# 2 circles between May 2014 - Aug 2014. 
# Staff rate trainings as valuable (6/7)+
# Montessori Families - talk to 3 tree, have a plan/ideas + have a name we like

h2. Simple Rules

p(hint). "Simple Rules":http://simplerulesfoundation.org/ lead to congruence in complex systems, like Schools :). These are the rules that guide our decisions.

h3. 1. Hear all voices

p(hint). This is about listening and really hearing

h3. 2. Sit on your hands

p(hint). When we are tempted to do something for someone that they can do for themselves, we will stop ourselves, even if it means sitting on our hands!

h3. 3. Ask for help, even if you don't need it

p(hint). We believe asking for help creates trust & community whether it's asking a child to help us wash the dishes, or asking a parent to help us in a bake sale.

h3. 4. Protect dignity

p(hint). To honor our belief in the capability + evolution of the peaceful child.

h3. 5. Take the next step

p(hint). Acknowledge what's in the way, define the need, and move forward. 

p(hint). Montessori believed that the job of guides is to both meet the child where she is but also to see the child not yet there and clear a pathway for her to bloom. We agree!
