Ideals with Realities:

Lighthouse Montessori's school vision is a more peaceful world, and
striving for peace is why each and every teacher in the classroom shows up
every morning. At the same time, we are working with very young children who
are just beginning to develop self-control and empathy. If we are truly going to 
help our children succeed, we have to meet them where they are with age-
appropriate expectations for their behavior. Here are two important qualities of 
young children to keep in mind with regard to peace and violence:

1) They possess very little self-control. Self-control is managed in the
prefrontal cortex, the most recently evolved part of our brains. The
prefrontal cortex is just beginning to develop in young children, and isn't
complete until age 25! Even in adults, when the brain is flooded with fear or
anger, communication from the prefrontal cortex shuts down. So even
though they know that hitting is “wrong”, in the heat of the moment that
message can't get through.

2) They are egocentric (and that's a good thing!). It is easy for us to
forget how little time these children have been alive – they are still
desperately trying to figure out their emotions, their bodies, and their place
in the world. Everything is about them, and it needs to be for them to have
a firm foundation and sense of self. This means that they are always
zoomed in to their own experience, and empathy is not reliably on-line until
about age six. It is a huge challenge for them to imagine how someone else
feels, and sometimes it is impossible.

We know that hitting and pushing, rough and tumble play, and even the
occasional bite will happen. We would be worried if the children did not try out
these methods! What we want is to minimize the harm done, give them the skills
they are lacking, and respond by increasing our connection.

Our response to violence:

To start, supervision is our most useful tool with this age group. We know
they are not yet peaceful, and so we are watching for when a conflict will occur.
While we want to give children the space to solve their own conflicts, when we
notice a conflict brewing a teacher will move nearby, ready to step in if
necessary.

Unfortunately, adults are not able to prevent all violence. When violence
does occur, we:

1. Separate and assess: Stop the hurt, and check to see if anyone is
injured. If they need first aid we will respond accordingly.

2. Help the children check on each other: When both parties are calm
(this could be after taking space), they will check on anyone who was
injured. They always ask in this same way:

a. “Are you hurt?”
b. “Where are you hurt?”
c. “What can I do for you?”
They can then help in taking care of each other by getting band-aids or ice
packs.

3. Peace stone conversation: Each child holds a physical stone and has
a turn to tell his/her story, then the other child repeats what he/she heard.
The adult also encourages children to share their emotions and to say
what they do not like or do not want to have happen again. At the end of
the conversation, the adult helps the children come to a decision about
how to deal with this type of situation in the future.

Why do we use the Peace Stone?

• Understanding & Amends > Punishment: Instead of a focus on
punishment, the peace stone conversation is a focus on understanding the
harm done and then making amends. As a leader of the restorative justice
movement writes, “those who have caused harm should begin to
understand the consequences of their behavior. Moreover, it means they
have a responsibility to repair the harm [. . . .] This is not only the 'right'
thing to do but is more likely than punishment to deter future offending.”
So, rather than the adult handing down a punishment, this conversation
allows the children to understand how they impacted each other, which
is how they will build empathy, and gives them a chance to make it right.

• Empower the harmed person: This approach empowers the
harmed person to tell his/her story and express that it was not okay. It
helps the person heal, and is far more of a deterrent for the other child
than an adult reminding them of a rule.

• Healing for all: Both children are given a chance to talk, and we
listen without judgment. In most cases, the child who is violent is missing a
skill. Giving them a chance to tell their story helps build a skill right then –
using their words – and helps the adults realize what they need to practice
in the future.

How will they learn something new?

Practice!!
Repeated practice with using words, getting help, and hearing their
friends' experiences is the only way they will learn something new. If we want
them to override the instinct to lash out when they are emotional, they must
practice these new skills so much that they become second nature; muscle
memory.

Role play is the best way to gain this muscle memory. We will often
replay a situation right after the peace stone conversation, practicing the peaceful
option, and often practice that skill with the children over the next few weeks as
well. Grace and Courtesies are a way to practice these skills at neutral times, and
in a fun manner, so that they become enmeshed in their neural pathways. In a
Grace & Courtesy lesson an adult shows a skit and then give the children a
chance to practice what was show. For example, “What to do when you are mad
at someone” (Tell them, I’m mad at you!)

How can you help at home?

Have peace stone conversations at home! We are happy to give
you more training and answer questions to get you started out in your
household.

When your child shares a story with you at home, ask about his/her
feelings from it and validate those feelings. Ask about what she/he might do next
time a friend does ___ (calls them a name, hurts their feelings, pushes them,
etc.) and always encourage them to come get teachers for help at school.
