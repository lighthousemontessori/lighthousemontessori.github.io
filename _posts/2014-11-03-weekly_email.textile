Hello Parents,

Sorry for the late email. The Chinook Book sale and For Small Hands are still going on. This week the Fare Trade fundraiser starts. This Wednesday is the Pint$ with Purpo$e at Ballard Beer Company. 

Jason will be in the classroom this week continuing his training. On Wednesday morning Brecca will be out of the classroom and I will be subbing for her. On Wednesday afternoon our dishwasher is being repaired and a repair person will be in the kitchen.
