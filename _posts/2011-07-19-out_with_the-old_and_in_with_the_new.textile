We just finished the last of the demolition at Lighthouse Montessori School. 
After taking out a wall and replacing it with posts, the whole room opened up and allowed for more
visibility in every portion of the classroom.
Extra bracing was installed on the ceiling joists to make the building safer and more earthquake resistant.

Cement was poured and walls were framed in preparation for the installation of dry wall.

Lighthouse Montessori School is truly becoming a nurturing building.

Upcoming landmarks to look forward to include:
* the installation of new windows
* the manufacturing of the Lighthouse Montessori School Sign for the front of the building
* drywall installation.

We appreciate all of the help, support, and encouragement of each individual that has made Lighthouse Montessori School a material representation of loving community.
