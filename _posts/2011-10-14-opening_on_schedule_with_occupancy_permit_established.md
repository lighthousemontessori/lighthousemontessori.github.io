Lighthouse Montessori School is on schedule to open January 3rd! The construction phase has been completed and our occupancy permit is established.

Many stages of construction have been accomplished including: the office, kitchen, and third bathroom. The second bathroom was remodeled and wood trim, doors, and 20 children's cubbies were installed. With the help of friends, volunteers, and parents the painting was completed including four accent walls and ceramic tile flooring was installed throughout the school.

To insure the current energy codes, an electrical company was brought in to polish off the lights and electrical needs. With the setting of the gas meter, we were able to move along through the inspections for the gas pipe, electrical, plumbing, and into the final inspection for the entire construction. During these activities inside, the outside received a stone patio,
sod, zen garden, trellis, fence, and a japanese tea house.

All the paper work has been turned in the the Washington State Department of Early Learning to bring us down the home stretch.

Furniture, shelves, and learning materials are being placed right now.

It is truly a building born of community interaction that cares, nurtures and shelters its users.
A warm thank you goes out to all of those whom have brought us to this point.

There is a standing invitation to schedule a visit to tour Lighthouse Montessori School, just email or call Karissa to arrange a time.
