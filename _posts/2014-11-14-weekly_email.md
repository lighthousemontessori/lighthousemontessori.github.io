The Chinook Book sale, For Small Hands credit program, and Fare Trade fundraiser are all still happening.

Karissa will be out Monday (Nov. 17th) and Brecca will be taking the lead and Koe will be filling in as an assistant.

There is a Gardening Volunteer Day on Saturday the 22nd. We will be winterizing our gardens, building garden boxes, laying new wood-chips, and doing some indoor cleaning for those who would like to help in a non-landscaping way. It starts at 10! Please RSVP if you'd like to join in.

There is a Parent Ed event being put on by NW Montessori. It will be about Continuing in Montessori Education. There will be two Montessori elementary teachers talking to parents who are considering having their children continue in Montessori education. It will be next Thursday, Nov. 20th at NW Montessori's Woodland Park Location. Please RSVP by next Monday so we can give them a heads up on how many to expect.
