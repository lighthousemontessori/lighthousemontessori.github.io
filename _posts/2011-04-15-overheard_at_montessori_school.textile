h3. Difference Between Humans and Animals

6-year-old girl:

"Hey Karissa" "Yeah?" "Do you know the difference between humans and other animals" "What's that?" "Humans have cracks on their bum and other animals have tails. I know, because I looked in my cat's bum" "Interesting discovery"

h3. Infinity

4-year-old girl: 

[While working on the thousand chain, a chain of 1000 beads that the child counts and labels at every ten] 

"Wow, Karissa, numbers just go on forever, don't they?" 

p(hint). [I love when children discover concepts like infinity]

h3. Pangaea

4-year-old boy: 

p(hint).[He has taken out the puzzle maps of all the continents and is putting all the pieces together, so I wandered over to see what was going on] 

Musing to himself, "I think this is how it was before, when these matched [he puts together Africa and South America]" 

We got out an encyclopedia and showed him a picture of Pangaea the next day. He was thrilled that the encyclopedia had a picture of his discovery, but wondered how they got it in there so fast. 

h3. Superheros

5-year-old boy (completely decked out in Batman raincoat, rain boots, and t-shirt) to 5-year-old girl on their way outside to play:

"Will you be Batgirl again today?"
