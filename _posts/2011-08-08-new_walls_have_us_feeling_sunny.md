title: New Walls Have Us Feeling Sunny

With the drywall installed, Lighthouse Montessori School is starting to take the
shape of a nurturing classroom. The shadows of the old building have receded with
the arrival and installation of new windows. The final touches of the fire safety requirements
have been completed.

We are onto the next phases of construction and a host of activities will proceed. The most notable of these will be the inside framing of the office, kitchen and an ADA bathroom. Electrical and plumbing will be happening at this time as well.

Indeed things are looking as sunny inside as they are outside.

Lighthouse Montessori School is a building born of community interaction with the purpose
of caring for and sheltering its users.

While our new walls were being put up, we were signing up new families. Five families have signed the parent contract and put down a deposit to hold their places in the school. The next seven families that sign the contract and put down a deposit will completely fill all spaces for the school year of 2011-2012.

Dont forget that on August 26th, the next Why Montessori: A Free Introduction for Parents will take place at the Ballard Library. This is a free class for anyone interested in knowing more about Montessori education. If you or a friend are interested, sign up today at: http://lighthousemontessori.com/parent\_classes

Here is a view of the new windows and drywall with the framing materials ready to go!
