Hello Parents,

From now on I'll be sending out a weekly email, usually on Fridays or at some point during the weekend if I happen to be in the classroom on Fridays.

The Chinook Book sale and For Small Hands fundraisers are still happening. The deadline for group orders is this Thursday, the 23rd. This Friday is the Halloween Crafternoon!

Karissa will be out of the classroom on Thursday and Friday, so Kevin and I will be covering for her. Brecca will have an observer in the classroom as a part of her Montessori Guide training on Friday. Also the dishwasher broke this last week and a repair person will be in the classroom sometime during Friday afternoon.

The Parent Ed that was planned for this weekend will be postponed due to Karissa being out of town.

Garrett
