Hello Parents,

The Chinook Book sale, For Small Hands credit program, and Fare Trade fundraiser are all still happening.

Jason will be in the classroom this week continuing his training. Carrie will be out on Friday and I will be subbing for her. Karissa will be out the next Monday (Nov. 17th) and Brecca will be taking the lead and Koe will be filling in as an assistant. 

There is a Parent Volunteer Event on Saturday the 15th. More details on that to come.

There is a Parent Ed on Thursday the 13th, being hosted by Pacific Crest. It starts at 7pm! I've attached the flyer below.
