h2. Fundraising at Lighthouse Montessori

A significant part of our yearly budget comes from parent and community fundraising. 

h3. Scholarships at Lighthouse: Support When it Matters Most

Living in poverty during the preschool years harms children more than at any other time--academically and economically. But imagine the difference three or four years of tailored learning in a nurturing environment could make for a child living at or below the poverty line.

Lighthouse scholarships fund a large percentage of tuition for our entire three- to four-year program. Children graduating from Lighthouse carry those years with them for the rest of their lives. We plant the seeds for a life of learning in an environment built to meet their developmental needs. Lighthouse supports children precisely when it can make the biggest difference.
