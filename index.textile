We are an all year, all day Montessori primary school with all day access to our outside environment. We are two trained teachers, three asistants, 26 children, and a community of parents, volunteers, and alumni!

We believe: Children can change the world; Children have an innate desire to learn; Social and emotional development is the foundation for learning.

Start getting to know us!
