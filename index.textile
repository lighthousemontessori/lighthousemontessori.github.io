h3. We are an all year, all day Montessori primary school with all day access to our outside environment. We are two trained teachers, three asistants, 26 children, and a community of parents, volunteers, and alumni!

h3. We believe that children can change the world, that children have an innate desire to learn, and that social and emotional development is the foundation for learning.
