Lighthouse Montessori is about community.  Whether you are a parent with children at our school, an interested parent, a community member with some time to donate, or just an individual who wants to know more about Montessori education, we have a place for you.

There are two ways to volunteer:

During school:
We love to have experts visit our classroom and teach us! If you know about cooking, scinece, crafts, culture, or just like to read children's books, we can schedule a time for you to visit us.

After school:
We can often use help in our garden, with building maintenance, and with keeping the classroom clean and beautiful. This is less "glamorous" but is part of what keeps the school running!
