**Q:** What are the hours?

**A:** We offer 2 programs : Dawn-to-Dusk is 7:30a-6p and Extended Day is 8:30a-3p. We preference families that are seeking the Dawn-to-Dusk program.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Q:** What ages go to your school?

**A:** 2 1/2 to 6 years old, a mixed age classroom.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Q:** How much is tuition?

**A:** It depends on your program and year and if you are a sibling of a current child. See our [tuition](/tuition) page for information.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Q:** We are interested in the extended hours, but won't need that everyday of the week. Is it possible to do extended hours some days and regular hours on others?

**A:** If a family is going to use extended hours on some days, it is required that they sign up for the extended day program. However, it is always possible to pick up your child at any point in the day. The easiest times on the child to do so are right before lunch around 12p, right after lunch around 1pm, and right after nap time around 3pm.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Q:** Can my child attend school on some days of the program, but not others?

**A:** In our experience, it is difficult for a child of this age to attend an extended day, week long program for only certain days a week. It is difficult for staff to have continuing lessons with the child and it is difficult for the child to adjust to the school schedule. However, the child may attend the program for five days a week, but keep limited hours on some days.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Q:** Are snacks and meals provided for the children?

**A:** The school provides snacks, parents are responsible for bringing lunch each day.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Q:** What disciplining technique do you use?

**A:** As a general principle, the Montessori method doesn't use reward or punishment. Researchers are finding that both of these methods are ineffective in the long term (see [Punished by Rewards](http://www.alfiekohn.org/books/pbr.htm)).

In their place, the Montessori method uses grace and courtesy lessons to teach children proper social behavior in the classroom. In these lessons, the guide gathers children in a small group and practices *one* skill, such as what to say when someone is in your way. These lessons don't single out individual children and are delivered routinely so that they can be referenced when a situation comes up. This is preventative and addresses the root cause of acting out.

When a child does act out, most of the time we are able to guide the child verbally to a safe choice for themselves and the children around them.

If the child is hurting themselves or someone else and will not stop, the guide will give them the choice of walking out of room with him / her or being carried out. Carrying a child out in this situation of the room is the only way a guide will be physical with a child.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Q:** What is the student to teacher ratio?

**A:** Our school will always have a ratio of at most 10 students to 1 adult. As a fully licensed program, this is a requirement for us. Furthermore, there will always be at least 1 trained Montessori guide (teacher) in the room with 1 - 2 assistants.

The first year of the school we will have less students and only one guide, so the first and last hours of the day will sometimes have a trained assistant, but not a fully trained guide present.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Q:** Will all employees go through a background check?

**A:** Absolutely. As a fully licensed program, we are required by law to ensure that every adult on our staff has had a background check.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Q:** How will your school be a sustainable practice? Will you be using environmental cleaning supplies? Are you using environmental supplies for your remodel?

**A:** We want to give children an experience of producing instead of consuming, with as little waste as possible. We plan do do this by:

-   having all real dishes, cloth towels, and cloth placemats in the classroom that will be washed and reused, minus only whatever products licensing requires us to provide as disposables
-   offering children opportunities to take care of their own environment, in line with the Montessori tradition
-   growing food in our garden
-   providing materials and time for children to create by baking, sewing, sculpting, painting, knitting, and more

The Department of Early Learning (the city department that licenses us) has very specific cleaning requirements. We are allowed to substitute bleach with more environment friendly products (I would like to use a product with Tea Tree Oil), if we approve it with our licensor first.

We are required by the current building and efficiency codes to build and light our space in an efficient manner. We are trying to use salvaged doors so we can recycle them. We are planning on using completely odor free paint. With lighting, we are trying to go beyond the code to qualify for environmental grants.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Q:** Will there be opportunities for parents to volunteer in the classroom or at the school?

**A:** Yes!!! We love parents to come in to do projects (baking, art, gardening, etc.), to share a cultural or family tradition with our classroom, or to present to us a skill that they have. This could be playing an instrument, dancing a dance, pediatricians have told us about germs, dietitians about food, etc. This is usually the easiest in the afternoon after lunch / nap time are out of the way, but can be worked in whenever.
