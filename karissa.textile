"Karissa is an amazingly patient and gifted Montessori teacher. My daughter has been in her class for 2 years and the progress she has made in that time with Karissa's guidance has been so impressive. She has grown to be a confident, independent learner, and Karissa always seems to know how to get the best out of her. I am confident that the Lighthouse School will be a warm and nurturing place for kids to learn and develop self confidence. I expect it will be a great success!"

Stacey Dillon, parent of former student

"It is a pleasure to recommend Karissa Lightsmith as a qualified Montessori guide and administrator. We are very happy that Karissa will administrate her own school. She is a very responsible, reliable and qualified teacher."

Barbara Madsen, administrator of Northwest Montessori School, former employeer

I can hardly believe my eyes as I see my own business, my dream, unfolding before me.  

Education has shaped my life. Being home-schooled by my mother, graduating with my undergraduate at 18-years-old, and finding the amazing Montessori Institute Northwest where I trained to be a Montessori teacher were all experiences that changed my life path. I have always wanted to be involved in a community that shares knowledge and discovery, now I am helping create one. 

There are many possibilities that I see turning to realities in this space. My community is supporting me in each step I take, from demolition to recommendations to kind words and I am so grateful. It is my passion to create an environment that meets each child and allows him or her to bloom. One reason I can do this is because I approach children from a developmental perspective. This way I am able to envision their overarching goals, even through their struggles to achieve them. I also believe that I can have a completely transparent environment, with parents and with my community. Parents and visitors are always welcome in the classroom. 

I want this school to be a place built by the community, for the community. I am looking for people who are passionate about children and the environments we build for them. I hope to convey to those around me how vital these first years of life are to the child, how we as a race must support all children in this fleeting time of self-construction. I am thrilled to be a part of a global movement that is not leaving the future of humanity to chance. A movement that recognizes the child as the creator of man, and treats him with compassion. 

Thank you for sharing in my dream and helping it grow!

Karissa Lightsmith
