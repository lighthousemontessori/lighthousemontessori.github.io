title: Recommendations for Karissa
---

"Karissa is an amazingly patient and gifted Montessori teacher. My daughter has been in her class for 2 years and the progress she has made in that time with Karissa's guidance has been so impressive. She has grown to be a confident, independent learner, and Karissa always seems to know how to get the best out of her. I am confident that the Lighthouse School will be a warm and nurturing place for kids to learn and develop self confidence. I expect it will be a great success!"

Stacey Dillon, parent of former student

"It is a pleasure to recommend Karissa Lightsmith as a qualified Montessori guide and administrator. We are very happy that Karissa will administrate her own school. She is a very responsible, reliable and qualified teacher."

Barbara Madsen, administrator of Northwest Montessori School, former employeer
